            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="description">
                I am Arunas Rancevas, a software engineering student currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at BYU-Idaho. Residing in Vilnius, Lithuania, my journey in technology has been driven by a long time fascination with it and its ability to shape the world around us.
                <br><br>
                I am deeply intrigued by the intricate workings of software and electronics, recognizing their pervasive impact on our daily lives. As I delve into the realm of programming, I am driven by a relentless curiosity to understand and keep up with the algorithms and structures behind every days innovations.
                <br><br>
                While my academic focus is on software engineering, I am aware of the importance of versatility in the ever-evolving tech industry. Therefore, I dedicate my free time to exploring AI-related libraries in Python and R, enriching my understanding of cutting-edge advances in software.I also enjoy reading documentation and delving deeper into these technologies.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, I find joy in full stack development, where I leverage my skills in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside backend frameworks such as Node.js and databases like MongoDB and MySQL. I love to create websites because it's a tangible way to bring ideas to life and connect people in the digital world.
                <br><br>
                I am currently interested in looking for work in full stack development. With a solid foundation in programming, a genuine interest in AI, and growing proficiency in full stack development I am eager to contribute meaningfully to projects that leverage my skills in full stack development and create impactful websites for clients.
